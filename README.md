Ana Rath, William Zeng

## initialize_particle_cloud
Implement: Initialize particle cloud to random positions
Test:

## update_particles_with_motion_model
Implement: Resample particles and update according to Monte Carlo Localization motion model
Test:

## update_particle_weights_with_measurement_model
Implement: Resample particles and update according to Monte carlo localization weight formula 
Test:

## normalize_particles and resample_particles
Implement: We will first normalize to get the sum of weights = 1 and then divide each weight by sum. Then, resample 
Test:

## updated_estimated_robot_pose
Implement:
Test: Get 2d pose estimate from RViz and compare with our output of estimated robot pose  

## How we will incorporate noise into our particle filter localization
Implement: Resampling particles from normal distribution generates noise 
Test:
